			|In October 1517 in Seville, Magellan contacted Juan de Aranda, Factor of the Casa de Contrataci√≥n.
			| Following the arrival of his partner Rui Faleiro, and with the support of Aranda, they presented their 
			|project to the Spanish king, Charles I, future Holy Roman Emperor Charles V. Magellan's project, if successful,
			|would realize Columbus' plan of a spice route by sailing west without damaging relations with the Portuguese.
			|The idea was in tune with the times and had already been discussed after Balboa's discovery of the Pacific.
			|On 22 March 1518 the king named Magellan and Faleiro captains so that they could travel in search of the 
			|Spice Islands in July. He raised them to the rank of Commander of the Order of Santiago. The king granted
			|them:[12]Monopoly of the discovered route for a period of ten years.
			|Their appointment as governors of the lands and islands found, with 5% of the resulting net gains.
			|A fifth of the gains of the travel.
			|The right to levy one thousand ducats on upcoming trips, paying only 5% on the remainder.
			|Granting of an island for each one, apart from the six richest, from which they would receive a fifteenth.
